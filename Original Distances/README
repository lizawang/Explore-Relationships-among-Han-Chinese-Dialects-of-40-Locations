### pickle files of distance computed using Levenshtein edit distance and TFIDF.

##### Basic Levenshtein edit distances:
initial_char_tone_alignments.pickle
initial_char_segment_alignments.pickle

##### Levenshtein edit distances with PMI:
final_char_tone_alignments.pickle
final_char_segment_alignments.pickle

##### TFIDF: 1gram=unigram, 3grams=(unigram, bigram, trigram):
