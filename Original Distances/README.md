### pickle files of tone and segment distances computed using Levenshtein edit distance and TFIDF.

#### Basic Levenshtein edit distances:
initial_char_tone_alignments.pickle <br>
initial_char_segment_alignments.pickle

#### Levenshtein edit distances with PMI:
final_char_tone_alignments.pickle <br>
final_char_segment_alignments.pickle

#### TFIDF: 1gram=unigram, 3grams=(unigram, bigram, trigram):
final_charPair_segment_1gram_distanceRatios.pickle  <br>
final_charPair_tone_1gram_distanceRatios.pickle   <br>
final_charPair_segment_distanceRatios_3grams.pickle   <br>
final_charPair_tone_distanceRatios_3grams.pickle
