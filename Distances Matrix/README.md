### Distances Matrix of distances of all language pairs which can be used in Gabmap.

### Note that the variant distance is computed by adding up the its seperated segment distance and tone distance. This is important because if a variant distance is computed directly without seperately computing segment and tone distances first and adding them up, the resulting variant distance is different.
